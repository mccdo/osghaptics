OpenSceneGraph Haptic Library - OsgHaptics is a library that integrates haptic rendering 
to the open source scenegraph OpenSceneGraph.

There are demo applications in the examples sub-directory

osgHapticviewer
---------------

Description: The use of a visitor to make any osg-model haptically rendereable.
Loads any model that osg supports and allows the user to touch it with the proxy.

Usage: osgHapticViewer <modelfile>
Example: osgHapticViewer cow.osg


dexterity_game
--------------
Description: A very simple version of the dexterity game. Try to move the ring object over
a wire without touching it.

Usage: dexterity_game <background model>
Example: dexterity_game room.ac

Make sure your current directory is the data sub-directory, or that you have OSG_FILE_PATH
referring to that directory.

material_demo
--------------
Description:   Demonstrates different surface properties in osgHaptics.
Uses a visitor (HapticMaterialVisitor that parses strings in node-descriptions 
to create an set properties on surfaces.

Usage: material_demo material_demo.osg

Make sure your current directory is the data sub-directory, or that you have OSG_FILE_PATH
referring to that directory.

forceoperator_demo
--------------------
Description: Demonstrates the use of a SpringForce operator (inside a HapticSpringNode)
to generate spring forces. In this example an animated named node is found, and the 
HapticSpringNode is attached as a child. The motion of the animated node is then transferred automatically
to the haptic spring. When enabled (F1) the haptic device will follow the motion.

Keys: F1 - Toggle spring on/off
F2 - Increase spring stiffness
Shift+F2 - Decrease spring stiffness


Usage: forceoperator_demo forceoperator_scene.osg
