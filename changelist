* 060515, Anders Backman:
 - Added material_demo, forceoperator_demo
 - Added consistent BBOX updates in all demos
 - Added pointer checks in HapticSpringNode

* 060515, Anders Backman
 - osgHapticViewer: 
  Added command-line options: 
  
  --proxy_scale <float>  - Scale the size of the model used as a visual proxy
  --constraint <float>   - Set the surface to be a constraint surface with snap_force specified
  --dynamic_friction <float> - Set the dynamic friction of the haptic surface 
  --static_friction <float> - Set the static friction of the haptic surface
  --damping <float> - Set the damping in the friction equation (spring)
  --stiffness <float> - Set the stiffness in the friction equation (spring)

  - osgHapticViewer
  
  Added command-line option:
  --remove_instances - Will do a deep copy of the loaded scene which will then be used as the haptic subgraph.
    This will effectively remove any instances that can cause problem with haptic rendering.

 - osgHapticViewer: 
 
  Added a simple Hash test for large meshes, including arguments for osgHapticViewer:
 
  --hash              - Hash the loaded model for intersection test
  --cell-size         - Size of the hash cell
  --render-triangles  - Do not render the triangles that are intersected with the proxy

  The hash test is an example of how to store triangles in a hash datastructure and to 
  only haptically render the triangles in proximity to the Haptic proxy.
  It has been tested with models with 300.000 triangles.
  Without hash I get: 
 
  Renamed arguments, using - instead of _
  
  --proxy-scale <float>  - Scale the size of the model used as a visual proxy
  --constraint <float>   - Set the surface to be a constraint surface with snap_force specified
  --dynamic-friction <float> - Set the dynamic friction of the haptic surface 
  --static-friction <float> - Set the static friction of the haptic surface
  --damping <float> - Set the damping in the friction equation (spring)
  --stiffness <float> - Set the stiffness in the friction equation (spring)
  --remove-instances
  
- Added arguments:
