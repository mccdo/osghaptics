  Added command-line options: 
  
  --proxy_scale <float>  - Scale the size of the model used as a visual proxy
  --constraint <float>   - Set the surface to be a constraint surface with snap_force specified
  --dynamic_friction <float> - Set the dynamic friction of the haptic surface 
  --static_friction <float> - Set the static friction of the haptic surface
  --damping <float> - Set the damping in the friction equation (spring)
  --stiffness <float> - Set the stiffness in the friction equation (spring)

  Added command-line option:
  --remove_instances - Will do a deep copy of the loaded scene which will then be used as the haptic subgraph.
    This will effectively remove any instances that can cause problem with haptic rendering.
