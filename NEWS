* Support for two (or more) Phantoms
  Thanks to the people at R&D Lab of the CUHK Jockey Club Minimally Invasive Surgical Skills Centre, Hong-Kong
  This required some changes both here and there.
  For example the HapticDevice::init() method is gone and is replaced by a setup scheme such as:
  
  Create new device
  call initDevice() <--- New method
  call createContext() <--- New method
  
  For dual devices the process is (has to be)
  
  Create device1
  Create device2
  
  call initDevice() for device1
  call createContext() for device1
  
  call initDevice() for device2
  call createContext() for device2
  
* 061119: VisualStudio 8 is now default for the project files.
  Older versions is available but will not be updated from now on.

* 061106: Removed the EventHandler class and replaced with a more general SensorEventHandler
  This will affect the code using the HapticDevice. Have a look into the pick_example_demo (pick_scene.cpp)
  for an example of how to use the new SensorEventHandler.
  
* 061108: Added sensorEventHandler_demo to demonstrate the osgSensor::SensorEventHandler.
* 060911: Added pick_example for demonstrating how to pick and manipulate objects in a scene.
* 060515 New demos: material_demo, forceoperator_demo
* 060509 Initial version, early stage.
